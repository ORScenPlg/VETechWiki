<p>The adopted targets for the state’s metropolitan areas are identified in OAR 660-044-0020 (Portland Metro) and 660-044-0025 (other MPOs) for various planning years. The targets are in units of GHG percentage reduction per capita resulting from light vehicle travel in a metropolitan area needed in the planning year in order to meet the state goal of a 75 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by the year 2050. They represent reductions in GHG emissions from light vehicle travel beyond what is expected to occur from improvements to vehicle technologies and fuels</p>

<div id="statewide-transportation-strategy" class="section level3" number="6.0.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.0.1</span> Statewide Transportation Strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#statewide-transportation-strategy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The Statewide Transportation Strategy (STS) was developed in response to legislative direction in Senate Bill 1059 (Chapter 85, Oregon Laws 2010), which required ODOT to develop a strategy on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions to aid the state in achieving the reduction goals set forth in ORS 468A.205 (a 75% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050). The STS identifies short- and long-term actions and strategies to reduce transportation-related GHG emissions in Oregon while supporting other important goals such as livable communities, economic vitality, and public health. Three key travel markets included in the STS are ground passenger and commercial services, freight, and air passenger. The STS was completed in 2013, and an ODOT Short-Term Implementation Plan created shortly thereafter. Among other efforts, the Implementation Plan calls for ODOT and DLCD to support scenario planning in metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>When the original metropolitan GHG targets were adopted by LCDC in 2011, the STS was still being developed requiring the targets to be set independent of the STS. The metropolitan GHG reduction targets adopted in 2017 were set assuming the future vehicle fleet, fuel, and technology assumptions set forth in the STS (built in collaboration with the Departments of Energy and Environmental Quality), as well as the statewide actions identified in the preferred scenario.</p>
<p>In addition to the travel of household members, the GHG Target rule travel definition also includes travel by light duty commercial vehicles related to household members or household demand (for example household deliveries. This allows metropolitan areas to get credit for vehicle programs such as compressed natural gas and renewable natural gas used in local commercial fleet and public transit vehicles.</p>
<p>The Target Rules specify that metropolitan areas may take credit for allowable state-led actions found in the Statewide Transportation Strategy (STS), which are reflected in the default emissions rates. These actions include pricing programs such as pay-as you-drive insurance, mileage based taxes (e.g. vehicle miles traveled fees), social cost recovery fee pricing (e.g., carbon tax), and congestion pricing (Metro area only).</p>
<p><strong>State-Led Policies</strong></p>
<p>A list of the key allowed state-led policies and actions are identified below. For the most current information, please contact DLCD/ODOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Cost Pricing, including Pay-as-you-Drive (PAYD) insurance, Mileage-based fees (e.g., gas tax replacement, expected surcharge from the Oregon Renewable Fuels Program)</li>
<li>Social cost recovery fees (e.g., through a carbon tax)</li>
<li>Electricity prices (reflecting costs to clean up the electric grid, important with the shift to electric vehicles)</li>
<li>Driving Efficiency Programs, including Eco driving and Low-rolling-resistance tire programs.</li>
</ul>
<div id="local-policies" class="section level5" number="6.0.1.0.1">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">6.0.1.0.1</span> Local Policies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#local-policies"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>Local Actions on Vehicles and Fuels: Localities can adopt policies that have a direct impact on local emission rates. These include provision of alternative fuels for light duty vehicles, such as Rogue Valley’s Clean Cities efforts that have developed a compressed natural gas (CNG) station that fuels government/ commercial vehicle fleets and buses, with plans to shift to cleaner renewable natural gas (RNG) (capturing landfill gas for fuel usage), or alternatively providing subsidies to increase adoption of hybrid or electric vehicles within the metropolitan area.</li>
<li>Operating Cost Impacts: Miles driven can be affected by the significantly lower operating costs with higher MPG and Electric Vehicles (on average gas-powered cars cost around three times as much per mile as electric vehicles, depending upon gas prices), or pricing policies that affect per mile fees. This is called the rebound effect and is important to account for in emissions models. That is, policies implemented to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) can have positive or negative impacts on emission rates (grams per mile).</li>
<li>Land Use Impacts: Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are powered both by electricity from the grid and by on-board fuels. The relative portions depend on the amount of use each day as well as the battery range. In general, households who live in denser areas are more likely to own PHEVs and these PHEVs will be more likely to power a larger portion of their travel using electricity rather than fuel because they have fewer daily miles traveled and/or shorter trips. The extent to which electricity can replace on-board fuel use, then those households will have lower emission rates as well as lower operated costs.</li>
<li>Congestion Impacts: Emissions rates for internal combustion engine vehicles are affected significantly by congestion because of efficiency losses due to idling and to frequent acceleration and deceleration. In contrast, the “stop-start” technology included in newer hybrid vehicles of all sizes, means idling, such as in congestion, emits significantly less emissions Local Policies can affect congestion and hence emissions rates.</li>
<li>ITS/Op Impacts: Newer Advanced Traffic Management programs, such as implemented on OR217 in Portland, including variable speed signs, changeable message signs and advance ramp metering, are designed to reduce congestion and incidents, but also have impact on emissions. “Speed harmonization” which limits acceleration and deceleration also reduce emissions from vehicles on the roadway.</li>
<li>Other Impacts: VMT-reducing policies consistently reduce emissions, but have an indirect and thus varying effect on congestion. For example, a policy which reduces VMT by limiting roadway capacity does so by increasing congestion (people make fewer vehicle trips or drive shorter distances to avoid spending more time on the road). On the other hand, a road pricing policy can reduce both VMT and congestion. If metropolitan areas identify other actions with substantial impact on emissions rate, estimation of the amount of GHG emissions reductions expected to result within the metropolitan area from these programs and actions may be allowable if analysis and methods are made in consultation with DLCD and ODOT.</li>

</h4>
<p>Beyond consistency with other state and local efforts, using RSPM in Target Rule calculations provides the following advantage over other tools (e.g., application of emission rates to travel demand model VMT):</p>
<ul>
<li>Matches the Target Rule’s definition of household-based travel emissions •</li>
<li>Captures impact of pricing and policy actions on travel and emissions •</li>
<li>Captures interaction of policy actions on travel behavior and emission rates (e.g., see Consideration #4 above)</li>

<p>This scenario would include the region’s best assessment of anticipated funding and policies, as represented in Regional Transportation Plans (RTP) and Transportation System Plans (TSP), and anticipated funding sources for transit and transportation options programs. It is recommended that other scenarios be run as well, reflecting more ambitious policies (e.g., longer time frame with more funding), as well as resilience testing of policies under alternative conditions (e.g., different economic growth and fuel price scenarios). This scenario planning approach can provide a basis for understanding “what would it take” to meet the targets, and provide the basis for discussion of GHG as well as other regional performance measures, resulting in a desired long term policy mix that meets the region’s goals.</p>
<p>Since the overall GOAL is to reduce per capita emissions by 89% from 2005 to 2050, the remaining per capita emissions in 2050 (gray slice) would be 11% of the 2005 emissions (100%- 89% = 11%). The blue slice indicates the reduction in per capita emissions due to the forecasted change in the light vehicle emissions RATE, i.e., expected improvements in vehicles and fuel policies. Since forecasted change in the emission rate would reduce per capita emissions by 83%, the remaining emissions in 2050 would be 17% of the 2005 emissions (100% - 83% = 17%) if only the forecasted changes to light vehicles and the fuels they use occur. An additional 6 percentage point reduction is necessary to meet the overall 89% reduction goal (89% – 83%). That represents 25% of the remaining emissions (6% ÷ 17%). This 35% is the 2050 Metropolitan TARGET for Portland Metro; the percentage reduction in emissions beyond the reductions expected from changes in vehicle technologies and fuels.</p>
<p>The overall GOAL (89% in figure 2), emission RATE (results in 83% reduction in figure 2), and resulting metropolitan TARGET (6% in figure 2) are shown in Table 3 for each year, reflecting Target Rule OAR 660-044. Analysis showing a metropolitan area meets either the TARGET or the GOAL is mathematically equivalent. Analysis must compare local light-duty GHG reductions relative to 2005, and show that the metropolitan region meets (A) the TARGET reduction of GHG reduction per capita beyond vehicle technologies and fuels (or equivalent GOAL reduction) as well as (B) comparing the change in the average vehicle emissions per mile to the default RATE.</p>
<p><strong>Process for Calculating the Target Rule Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Targets vs Goals Communicating what the existing targets mean and how they relate to other expressed goals (e.g. reducing total emissions statewide by 75%) is challenging. The TARGET is not a percent of total emission reductions or a percentage point portion of the overall reduction. In some circumstances, it may be useful to communicate using the GOAL, i.e., the overall reduction in total per capita emissions, including the impacts from vehicles and fuels. In contrast, the TARGET makes an additional step to remove reductions from vehicle and fuel policies to be comparable to the Target Rule Table 3 values.</p>
<p>Using the RULE (overall emissions reductions per capita) rather than the TARGET (emission reductions beyond the default vehicle and fuels emission rate) may be easier to explain given that it involves less steps (skips step 4) and is somewhat more comparable units with the statutory statewide GHG emissions reduction requirement (75% between 1990 and 2050 in total state emissions, which translates to 89% in per capita emissions just within metropolitan areas between 2005 and 2050). Since the RULE and TARGET are mathematically equivalent, either can be used in communication.</p>

<p><strong>INPUTS</strong></p>
<p>Each scenario has 2 sets of inputs with potentially multiple versions, as shown in the table below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>State led policies:</strong> These are largely vehicle, fuels, and pricing policies (Metro only opted for PAYD). <strong>STS</strong> Vision were set in 2011 and evolved to VisionEval. Adopted Plans change over time, reflecting current plans and trends. <strong>AP18-ish</strong> inputs were shared with Metro in 2020, new <strong>AP22</strong> inputs reflects latest DEQ policies (e.g., HB2021 Electricity carbon intensity may not fully be represented until law is negotiated with utilities. )</li>
<li>
<strong>Local policies:</strong> These inputs are developed by Metro. Thaya developed the <strong>Ref2020</strong> inputs for PBOT work. <strong>CSS</strong> local policy inputs are from 2011 and may still be GreenSTEP files that need to be converted to VisionEval.</li>

<p><strong>VisionEval Model Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>These inputs are combined to create 3 scenarios, once AP22 replaces AP18</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Climate Smart Vision Scenario</strong> (STS + CSS) –This is the preferred path that reaches the region’s required GHG reduction, used as a roadmap. It will not change. We can still get there if we go off this path, which is OK as long as we compensate to still reach the goal.</li>
<li>
<strong>Current Adopted Plans Scenario</strong> (AP22 + Local Reference Case) – This is our best guess of our current path, both state &amp; local actions.</li>
<li>
<strong>TargetRule Adopted Plans Scenario</strong> (STS + Local Reference Case) – This is a hybrid scenario that will not happen, only used for tracking progress on the TargetRule. It allows us to isolate the gap in local policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ANALYSIS FRAMING</strong></p>
<p>To identify the gap in local policies. Compare Climate Smart Vision inputs with inputs in either Adopted Plans scenarios (same local policies). This would be level of transit service, level of parking coverage. Some policies may exceed the static vision, some may fall short.</p>
<p>To show progress. We care about the net impact of these policies on GHG. Two ways to show progress on GHG relative to the Climate Smart Vision scenario, depending upon which Adopted Plans scenario is compared.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing to <strong>TargetRule Adopted Plans scenario</strong> gives legal progress on Targetrule. Shows progress on Metro’s part of the statewide STS vision. Oregon would meet the statewide GHG targets if everyone did their part and we had the same conditions as 2011 (income, fuel price)</li>
<li>Comparing to <strong>Current Adopted Plans Scenario</strong> gives actual progress in the region. It reflects actual progress on statewide actions under current conditions (income, fuel price).</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative Adopted Plans scenarios are also useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity tests can identify the GHG impact of more ambitious local policies that fill the gap allowing the region to meet or exceed its legal TargetRule GHG reduction.</li>
<li>Resilience tests can identify the GHG impact where some policies are at risk of falling short of plans, or outcomes are uncertain.</li>
