# Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to inform metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) staff, local planners, and decision makers in Oregon about the resources and steps used to conduct Scenario Planning. More specifically, this guide:

-   Provides some background on the planning processes, support available to metropolitan areas, and the Vision Eval model;

-   Outlines the process and steps for conducting a scenario planning exercise and how to assess scenarios against the metropolitan region’s GHG reduction target, as supported using the VisionEval model;

-   Explains the Vision Eval model, key inputs, scenario set-up, outputs, how to interpret these results; and

-   Links to technical information about the Vision Eval model.

## Oregon transportation and greenhouse gas reductions planning

Scenario Planning is a process to assist metropolitan areas and local governments to develop long range transportation and land use plans for their regions and communities. The VisionEval tool supports that process and helps metropolitan areas and local governments explore several paths:

-   Evaluate the outcomes of their existing plans and various sensitivity testing through a Strategic Assessment,

-   Engage in scenario planning to evaluate a set of different future scenarios.

-   Both options measure progress towards the regional greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target.

Scenario Planning with VisionEval helps to implement the Oregon Statewide Transportation Strategy: A 2050 Vision for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction (STS). The STS is a state-level planning effort that examines all aspects of the transportation and supporting land use system, including the movement of people and goods, and identifies a combination of strategies to reduce GHG emissions. The Oregon Transportation Commission agreed with the general course of action presented in the STS in 2013 to reduce transportation related GHG emissions, formally adopting it into the Oregon Transportation Plan in 2018.

### Strategic Assessment

A Strategic Assessment projects the results of implementing adopted plans, and explores the projected outcomes of a wide range of potential policy changes, without identification of a final preferred scenario. It can be a stand-along study or as the first step of scenario planning. The assessment is conducted as a staff level exercise, with none to low public engagement.

A Strategic Assessment provides metropolitan areas with an opportunity to evaluate how their region’s transportation system will perform in the future assuming that current plans are carried out and current trends continue. GHG emissions reduction is an important performance measure from Strategic Assessments among other components. The modeled future year is flexible to complement regional long range planning. Sensitivity testing – or ‘what if’ analyses to help planners understand what the relative effect of changes – can evaluate how investments, policy changes and trends influence GHG emissions and other indicators. Sensitivity testing can be used to evaluate a wide range of variables such as the impact of increasing downtown density, doubling transit service, or speed limit changes.

Metropolitan areas can use the results of a Strategic Assessment to inform development of transportation plans and investment priorities. In addition, a Strategic Assessment can help the metropolitan area governments to develop a long-range vision for their region which addresses community goals and prepares the community for the future.

### Scenario Planning

Scenario planning allows communities to explore the potential benefits of a variety of different land use and transportation related scenarios in order to identify a single preferred scenario for the region that achieves the regional GHG target. Scenario planning encourages local policy makers, planners and stakeholders to consider a wider range of opportunities, challenges, uncertainties, and possible futures than are typically considered in most traditional planning processes. Through the process of conceiving, developing and evaluating a series of future scenarios and the outcomes they produce, communities can obtain information for decision-making that combines real community values with choices and options for on the ground solutions. Scenario Planning is required for the Portland, Eugene and Salem region metropolitan areas, as of the year 2023. The process is voluntary for other Oregon MPOs.

### State Support

The Oregon Departments of Transportation (ODOT) and Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) provide support to metropolitan areas interested in engaging in strategic assessments and scenario planning. Metropolitan areas can request financial and technical assistance to support regional planning processes. The funding can be used to cover local agency staff time associated with data collection, model assembly and calibration, and other costs associated with the Strategic Assessment or scenario planning process. DLCD staff provides assistance with GHG target requirements and reporting of results and ODOT staff provides modeling assistance and runs analyses, in addition to providing overall project management support.

### Legislation, Rules and State Policy Scenario Planning

Several laws and rules govern land use and transportation planning for GHG emissions reductions in Oregon. These are described below in chronological order.

#### House Bill 2001 (passed 2009)

House Bill 2001 (HB 2001) created requirements for scenario planning in the Portland Metro and Eugene/Springfield metropolitan areas. In both communities, the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) had to meet a greenhouse gas emissions target adopted by the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC). These regional targets are the metropolitan elements of the Statewide Transportation Strategy (published in 2013, also mandated by HB 2001, more detail below), the state’s roadmap for meeting Oregon’s transportation emissions goal (ORS 468A.205). In Portland, Metro prepared, cooperatively selected, adopted, and is implementing a land use and transportation scenario to reduce greenhouse gases. In Eugene-Springfield, the Central Lane Metropolitan Planning Organization (CLMPO) identified and cooperatively selected a scenario, but was not required to adopt or implement a scenario. HB 2001 directed DLCD and ODOT to provide technical and financial support to the scenario planning efforts, with support from ODEQ and ODOE on the vehicle and fuel assumptions.

#### Senate Bill 1059 (passed 2010)

Senate Bill 1059 (SB 1059) created further requirements for LCDC to develop and adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets to guide metropolitan areas in their scenario planning efforts. SB 1059 also contained requirements for ODOT to create the Statewide Transportation Strategy (STS) and for both ODOT and DLCD to create Scenario Planning Guidelines, develop modeling tools, provide technical support, and create a Greenhouse Gas Reductions Toolkit.

#### Oregon Administrative Rule 660-044 Target Rules (OAR 660-044)

OAR 660-044 sets targets for greenhouse gas reductions in metropolitan areas of the state (Portland Metro, Central Lane, Corvallis Area, Bend, Rogue Valley, and Salem-Keizer) to help meet the statewide target of reducing GHG emissions to 75 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2050. The rules include a process for development, evaluation, approval, and implementation of a preferred land use and transportation scenarios. In 2017, the commission adopted technical amendments that:

-   Set a higher separate target for Metro, and single target for the other metropolitan regions

-   added two new MPOs (Albany and Grants Pass)

-   extended targets to the year 2050

-   new population growth assumptions

-   incorporated STS future assumptions of vehicles and fuels.

#### Oregon Statewide Transportation Strategy (STS)

The STS is a state-level scenario planning effort that examines all aspects of the transportation system, including the movement of people and goods, and identifies a combination of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions. It was developed in 2013 and adopted into the Oregon Transportation Plan as policy in 2018. The STS identifies a variety of effective GHG emissions reduction strategies in transportation systems, vehicle and fuel technologies, and urban land use patterns. It includes strategies to encourage the use of improved vehicle technologies and fuels; improve the state’s transportation system and provide more options; and encourage people to drive less or travel in ways that produce fewer emissions.

ODOT developed the STS over 2 years through extensive research and technical analysis, as well as policy direction and technical input from local governments, industry representatives, metropolitan planning organizations, state agencies and others. Progress on the STS is monitored through the Oregon Transportation Emissions website (https://www.oregontransportationemissions.com/).

#### Oregon Executive Order 20-04

In March 2020, Governor Brown issued Executive Order 20-04 which boosted Oregon’s goals to reduce GHG emissions to at least 45 percent below 1990 emissions levels by 2035 and to at least 80 percent below 1990 emissions by 2050. The Executive Order directs several state agencies, including ODOT, to take immediate actions to address climate change. The Executive Order directs ODOT to add a GHG reduction lens to project investment decisions in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program planning process, conduct a statewide needs analysis for transportation electrification charging infrastructure, and provide reporting on progress.

## Climate Friendly equitable communities rulemaking

LCDC launched the Climate-Friendly and Equitable Communities rulemaking in September 2020. The commission directed DLCD to draft changes in Oregon’s planning rules for communities in Oregon’s eight most populated areas. The rules require those communities to change their local transportation and land use plans to ensure Oregonians have safe, comfortable ways to get around and don’t have to drive long distances just to meet their daily needs. Reducing driving is one of the most important ways to reduce pollution. Communities can reduce the number and length of driving trips by local actions that bring land uses closer together, increase the walkability of the built environment, and mix land uses. When done well, in combination with supportive transportation policies this gives Oregonians more choices to take public transit, bike, or walk to get around.

The rules include several elements affecting Oregon transportation and land use planning:

-   **Developing Climate-Friendly Areas:** A climate friendly area is envisioned as an urban mixed-use area containing a greater mix and supply of housing, jobs, businesses, and services, and where residents and visitors can meet most of their daily needs without having to drive. Climate-friendly areas are important because a key component of Oregon’s plan to meet climate pollution reduction and equity goals is facilitating development of areas in which residents are less dependent upon the single occupant vehicle. The rules require cities, and some urbanized county areas, with a population over 5,000 within the seven metropolitan areas to adopt regulations allowing walkable mixed-use development in defined areas within urban growth boundaries. For Portland Metro, the rules are applied to the Metro 2040 centers including Portland Central City, town centers, and regional centers. Associated requirements will ensure high quality pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure is available within these areas to provide convenient transportation options.

-   **Reforming Costly Parking Mandates:** Excess parking has a significant negative impact on housing costs, business costs, the feasibility of housing development and business redevelopment, walkability, air and water pollution, climate pollution, and general community character. Parking mandates force people who don’t own or use cars to pay indirectly for other people’s parking. The rules encourage the diversity of parking needs to be met by the diversity of development. The rules would reduce or remove costly parking mandates for desired types of development, such as smaller housing types, small businesses, childcare facilities, multi-family housing, and historic buildings. The rules would completely remove parking mandates within one-half mile of frequent transit and three-quarters of a mile of rail stops, where parking demand is lower per unit.

-   **Getting Ready for Oregon’s Electric Vehicle Future:** Making vehicles cleaner is a key part in meeting Oregon’s climate goals. Oregon has a vision where 90% of new vehicles will be electric by 2035 and to meet this goal, people should be able to charge their vehicles. Many Oregonians live in older multi-family homes that would be very expensive to retrofit with electric vehicle charging ports. Thus, the rules require new housing and mixed-use development with at least five units would include electrical conduit (pipes) to 40% of spots, ready for adding wiring and charging stations to support electric vehicles as the market expands.

-   **Planning for a Future of Transportation Options:** The updated rules would require local governments in metropolitan areas to plan for greater development in transit corridors and downtowns, where services are located and less driving is necessary, prioritize system performance measures that achieve community livability goals, prioritize investments for reaching destinations without dependency on single occupancy vehicles, including in walking, bicycling, and transit, plan for needed infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, and regularly monitor and report progress.

-   **Planning to meet climate goals:** DLCD’s regional greenhouse gas reduction program allows areas to work together to consider statewide, regional, and local needs and issues. The flexible regional planning process allows communities to study economic development, fiscal impacts, resource use, pollution impacts, and the effects of different choices on the state, region, community, or households. The results are intended to help local government community members, elected and appointed leaders better understand issues and quantify the effect of potential policies as they review and update the area’s long-range plans and make investment decisions.

-   **Community Engagement:** A variety of Oregonians have been engaged over the past eighteen months, including a 40-person advisory committee with representatives from all of Oregon’s eight impacted areas. The rules require local governments to engage their communities as they make key decisions on how the rules apply locally, and upcoming conversations include events focused on what will be needed at the community level to support implementation and ongoing engagement strategies.

### Equitable Mapping, Engagement, and Decision-Making

One central outcome of this rulemaking is an increased emphasis on equity. Equity was key as DLCD attempted to have the composition of the advisory committee reflect the diversity of Oregon’s communities, and equity was one of the first tasks tackled by the group.

The rules define traditionally underserved populations to include Black and African American people, Indigenous people, People of Color, people with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities, low-income Oregonians, youth and seniors, and more. They require engagement with traditionally underserved populations, local consideration of anti-displacement actions should decisions contribute toward displacement, centering the voices of underserved populations in decision-making, and regular reporting on efforts to engage traditionally underserved populations.

What is VisionevalVisionEval is Oregon’s preferred strategic planning tool at the state and local level. It is also the updated version of Oregon’s statewide GreenSTEP model, which was developed by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to conduct long- range strategic planning. This tool was used to develop the STS and the metropolitan region GHG targets and the 2023 Oregon Transportation Plan. VisionEval’s attention to pricing policies, fleet electrification, and the ability to examine many possible futures is especially important today in an environment of limited funding and future uncertainties.

VisionEval demonstrates how community development and transportation investment choices could influence planning goals, land use goals, and other community livability factors. The model forecasts how different factors interact, such as the effect that parking policies may have on transit use, or how different development types could affect trip lengths.

Using Vision Eval, planners can determine key paths to reaching community goals including greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, test the resilience of current plans under alternative conditions, determine total household vehicle travel, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions regardless of where the travel occurs, analyze the effects of dozens of different factors on vehicle travel and greenhouse gas emissions levels, calculate household walking trips, bicycling potential, total household vehicle travel expenses, and road user fee revenues.

#### VisionEval’s comparison to traditional travel demand models:

-   Easier inputs and shorter run times—good for visioning and screening multiple future scenarios.

-   Ability to test policy impacts not available in most travel demand models (see inside for VisionEval input examples.)

-   Accounts for the effects of household income, pricing policies, shifts in vehicle technologies, and changes in future fuel costs on travel behaviors.

-   Can use travel demand model and/or land use model assumptions for consistency.

-   Focuses on broader policy actions. More detailed models are still needed to determine how best to implement a preferred scenario.

## History of Strategic Models

### GreenSTEP Family of Models

The VisionEval framework is built on the following models:

The [**GreenSTEP**](http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Planning/Documents/GreenSTEP-Model-Overview.pdf) (Greenhouse gas State Transportation Emissions Planning) model was the first model in the strategic planning family, developed by ODOT. ODOT developed the model to assist in the development of plans to reduce GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles, to meet Oregon State statutory goals. GreenSTEP models the effects of many different factors (e.g. transportation supply, prices, land use, etc.) on household vehicle ownership and use, and the effects on emissions, traffic congestion, and other responses.

The **EERPAT** model (Energy and Emissions Reduction Policy Analysis Tool) is largely identical to GreenSTEP. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) altered the GreenSTEP code to make the tool available and more accessible for other states across the country to use. The changes from the original GreenSTEP model include revisions made to the code to add estimated submodules for state-specific components (e.g., household income). The first version of EERPAT available for states (version 3.0) was pilot tested by four DOTs—Vermont, Maryland, Colorado, and Washington—and has since been deployed in Utah and Massachusetts. FHWA continues to maintain EERPAT and updated the model (most recently to version 4.0 in 2017).

The [**RPAT**](https://planningtools.transportation.org/551/rapid-policy-analysis-tool.html) (Rapid Policy Analysis Tool) was developed under the federal Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2). The model was developed to help planners evaluate the potential effect of growth policies on regional travel. Portions of the GreenSTEP model were used in RPAT, but substantial revisions were made to the code, including use of land use place type categories.

The [**RSPM**](http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Planning/Documents/RSPM-Quick-Summary.pdf) (Regional Strategic Planning Model) was developed by ODOT as an offshoot of the GreenSTEP model to support the preparation of metropolitan area scenario plans. The name reflects a broadening of the policies, beyond state actions. This model operates largely at the zonal level (i.e., inputs and outputs are zone-based).

### VisionEval Models

Three models are currently available in the VisionEval framework: VE-RSPM, VE-RPAT, and VEState. The VE-RSPM and VE-RPAT models are functionally the same as the earlier RSPM and RPAT models, respectively. VE-State is the newest addition to the VisionEval project. The VE-State model is essentially a state level version of VE-RSPM. Like VE-RSPM, the State model operates at the zonal level, but the zones are larger than their VE-RSPM counterpart and can account for multiple metro areas within the model region.

While both VE-RSPM and VE-RPAT function as regional models, one key distinction is the level of spatial detail.

VE-RPAT operates primarily at the region level and therefore requires inputs at the region or place type level. As shown below, place types are defined as a combination of area type and development type. Area type (or regional role) describes the interdependencies of each neighborhood compared to the rest of the region, e.g., how centered is it to jobs in the region. Development type (or neighborhood character) is used to describe the physical characteristics of each neighborhood in isolation. Operating at the place type level simplifies the input data requirements and the spatial precision of outputs while still capturing the effects of the different place types in the region. A synthesis of smaller zones, enables VE-State and VE-RSPM to use the same code.

VE-RSPM models the region in zones (in a manner similar to traditional travel model zones), which results in improved spatial resolution of outputs, but which also increases the data development burden. The selection of the right tool therefore depends on a number of factors – available data, project resources, desired spatial output detail, etc.

## Visioneval Modeling Framework

All VisionEval models share a common framework composed of eight modeling steps (Figure 2). Each step includes several calculations, each determined through the statistical analysis of several data sources such as the National Household Travel Survey and the Census, that operate on the input data and the results of the previous calculation step. The steps define households and associated policies, characterize vehicle ownership of those households, calculate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and emissions, balance VMT with travel costs, and finally estimate non-household travel and emissions (e.g., from commercial trucks or rail).

The model framework disaggregates travel demand impacts at an individual household level. Modeling at the household level makes it possible to evaluate the relationships between travel, emissions and the characteristics of households, land use, transportation systems, vehicles, and other factors. In addition, household level analysis makes it possible to evaluate the equitability of the costs and benefits of different strategies.

The model iterates through the last couple of steps to balance household travel with costs. The iterative process to balance the VMT with travel costs allows congestion and other costs introduced at this step to influence the amount of travel. This step balances the amount of household travel with the cost of travel and recalculates household VMT, fuel use, and GHG emissions in the process. The primary outputs of VisionEval are household travel, fuel and power consumption, and GHG emissions calculations, but other information is produced for households and commercial vehicles as well. The amount of commercial (light‐duty) and freight (heavy duty) travel is calculated as well as associated fuel, power consumption and GHG emissions for those vehicles.

**Figure 2: VisionEval Model Framework schematic**

Figure 2 shows how the basic model steps can be grouped into broader concepts. More information on each of these concepts are detailed in the VisionEval wiki, linked in Table 1.

VisionEval models, particularly the more robust VE-RSPM and VE-State models, consider a large number of factors which affect the performance of transportation systems and their effects on people and the environment. The models were made with the intention of estimating and forecasting the effects of various policies and other influences on the amount of vehicle travel, the types of vehicles and fuels used, and the resulting GHG emissions among other outcomes.

The VisionEval models can assess the following situations (not exhaustive):

-   Changes in population demographics (age structure);

-   Changes in personal income;

-   Relative amounts of development occurring in metropolitan, urban and rural areas;

-   Metropolitan, other urban, and rural area densities;

-   Urban form in metropolitan areas (proportion of population living in mixed use areas with a well interconnected street and walkway system);

-   Amounts of metropolitan area transit service;

-   Metropolitan freeway and arterial supplies;

-   Auto and light truck proportions by year;

-   Average vehicle fuel economy by vehicle type and year;

-   Vehicle age distribution by vehicle type;

-   Electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)

-   Light-weight vehicles such as bicycles, electric bicycles, electric scooters, etc.;

-   Pricing – fuel, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), parking;

-   Demand management – employer-based and individual marketing;

-   Car-sharing;

-   Effects of congestion on fuel economy;

-   Effects of incident management on fuel economy;

-   Vehicle operation and maintenance – eco-driving, low rolling resistance tires, speed limits;

-   Carbon intensity of fuels, including the well to wheels emissions; and

-   Carbon production from the electric power that is generated to run electric vehicles.

## Scenario Planning Options in Oregon

Oregon has a long tradition of strategic and outcome driven long range land use and transportation planning. Scenario planning can help communities develop a long-range vision for the future. Scenario planning allows a community to look long-term and envision the future it wants, rather than accept the trend line embodied in most existing plans. Scenario planning encourages policy makers, stakeholders, and the public to think outside the box and consider a wider range of opportunities, challenges, and possible futures than typically considered in most traditional planning applications. ODOT and DLCD often support or lead these planning efforts.

The process improves understanding of the impacts and tradeoffs of different policy options and promotes community resilience as lifestyle and travel paradigms change.

Models like VisionEval help communities prepare for alternate futures and evaluate strategies to grow toward a preferred future through strategic choices. During the scenario planning process, agencies can use VisionEval to assess whether adopted plans and policies are sufficient to achieve their planning goals. If policy shifts or more ambitious actions are needed to achieve goals or address future uncertainties, VisionEval can be used to test and identify strategies which offer the most beneficial impacts.

### Strategic Assessment

A Strategic Assessment evaluates a region’s adopted plans and policies, assesses how far those plans help the region reach its goals over the next 20 years, and identifies alternative paths to achieving those goals. It also identifies the local effects of state-led actions such as newer clean vehicles and fuels. The assessment provides valuable information that can help inform decisions about the future, helping communities to understand where the current path will take us and what options exist for the region. This can inform plan updates and general decision-making. Additional work may be desired to help answer specific policy questions or to evaluate many scenarios to test policy resilience given future uncertainties and/or formulate a vision for the region.

The purpose of the Strategic Assessment is to estimate the transportation and land use outcomes likely to result if adopted plans are implemented and current trends continue, using metrics such as household travel costs, GHG emissions and vehicle miles traveled. The results of a Strategic Assessment can help the region determine whether current plans and trends are achieving the long-term outcomes the region wants to see and identify potential actions to better meet the region’s goals, that can inform more specific investments and policies in financially constrained long range transportation plans.

The Strategic Assessment requires less time than scenario planning because it presents trends and outcomes, with options for the future, rather than selecting one shared alternative scenario. The results of the assessment help local governments better understand issues and quantify the effect of adopted policies as they review and update the area’s transportation plans and make investment decisions through existing planning processes.

A key value of the Strategic Assessment is the ability of the metropolitan area to assess the relative effect of various potential actions to or beyond the reference case on GHG emissions and the other evaluation measures. These include changes in local investments, programs, and/or policy direction. In order to streamline this process, the ODOT staff may recommend the following set of sensitivity tests:

-   More compact and mixed land use patterns

-   Increased transit service levels

-   Increased shift of short-distance single-occupant vehicles (SOV)

-   Expanding parking pricing programs

-   Improving driving efficiency

-   Expanding travel demand management programs

-   Future uncertainties:

    -   Income and population growth

    -   Improvements in vehicle technology

    -   Road User fees, and fuel pricing

### Preferred Scenario

Building off a Strategic Assessment, metropolitan areas may choose to engage in a scenario planning process to select a preferred scenario. Whereas the Strategic Assessment provides metropolitan areas with a glimpse of its future under status quo conditions, a scenario planning process will help local jurisdictions and MPOs arrive at a vision of what mix of investments and programs are required to best meet regional goals. Scenario Planning leading to a preferred scenario that meets regional GHG reduction targets is required for the Portland, Eugene and Salem region metropolitan areas, as of the year 2023. The process is voluntary for other Oregon MPOs.

A regional scenario planning process can address a wide range of planning issues because it allows metropolitan areas to evaluate an array of actions and metrics related to community goals. The analysis, coupled with an effective public and stakeholder involvement process, will allow for creation and examination of alternative scenarios. These scenarios allow communities to assess and arrive at a preferred mix of strategies for the achievement of local goals and GHG emissions reduction. This mix of policies informs long range plans where more detailed actions and models are used to determine how best to implement the preferred scenario.

Through the process, the communities making up the metropolitan area can arrive at an agreed upon collective vision for the future, and identification of land use and transportation strategies that can help the metropolitan area achieve the outcomes described by the vision. Though the vision will be shared, the steps to achieve it may be unique to each of the communities within a metropolitan area. The VisionEval model can inform those regional differences, both input actions and impact on outcomes.
