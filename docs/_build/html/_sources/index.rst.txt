VE Wiki documentation
==============================


The purpose of this wiki is to provide an in-depth technical resource for those developing strategic travel models in Oregon built on the VisionEval (VE) platform. Oregon specific policies and data inputs are used throughout.

This wiki focuses on the VisionEval Regional Strategic Planning Model (VE-RSPM), intended for metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) staff, statewide planners, local planners, and other decision makers interested in regional scenario planning to assess the impacts of different transportation and land use policies.

More information on the VisionEval project can be accessed at the following links:

_Documentation of the Pooled Funds VE Development https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki
_Development of VisionEval: https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev
The VisionEval project website: https://visioneval.org/
The current binary release of VisionEval available for download: https://visioneval.org/category/download.html
This wiki is intended to sit between the detailed information on the VisionEval GitHub site and the planning level documents which discuss the benefits and reasoning for using a strategic model.
This VE Primer is the introduction to the detailed tool information which will be linked to throughout this technical wiki: https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/VisionEval-Primer
