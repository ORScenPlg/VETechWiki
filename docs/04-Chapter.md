# Future Models to Evaluate Progress to the region's GHG Reduction Target

Scenario planning often requires the assessment of large numbers of future scenarios, each assessing a different combination of prioritizations, policy decisions, and constraints.

### Oregon GHG Target Rule Guidance

The Oregon state target rule guidance requires that metropolitan area must assess their greenhouse gas targets as a reduction in per capita emissions from household-based light-duty vehicles within the MPO jurisdiction by 20% from 2005 levels by 2035 and 35% by 2050, slightly higher for the Portland region.

These reductions are considered “above and beyond” those accounted for in expected changes in the vehicle fleet, fuels, and fuel prices. The rule states, *“The greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets as provided in OAR 660-044-0020 and 660-044-0025 [other non Portland area MPOs] are the ratio of future year to base year vehicle miles traveled per capita after controlling for the effects of state and federal policies and other conditions on vehicles, fuels, and pricing.”*

The assumed state and federal actions and policies are informed by the adopted Statewide Transportation Strategy (STS), monitored through the Oregon Transportation Emissions website (https://www.oregontransportationemissions.com/). Regional actions can include state-led actions and policies beyond the STS, as long as the metropolitan region has the authority to implement and carry out those actions. Regional actions can reduce GHG further than the STS policies if those regional polices are agreed to by ODOT and the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD). For example, regional policies which may reduce GHG further than the planned STS and regional pathway could consist of incentives to induce higher electric vehicle use for transit or commercial vehicles.

### Implementing the Target Rule

The target rules identify a total GHG reduction (i.e., the “Goal”) through the achievement of a per capita reduction in total GHG emissions. To better assess the effects of regional policies, while also controlling for state, federal, and overall market uncertainties, the target rule also has a “Target” defined as reductions in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per capita.

After controlling for the state-led future vehicle and fuel actions, and official population forecast assumptions, the metropolitan targets represent a household-based vehicle miles travelled per capita reduction goal, consistent with regional influence. Pricing policies are another key state-led action allowed to be assumed in tracking progress to regional targets. This includes per mile fees that are increased to cover the cost of the transportation system, and congestion pricing on freeways in the Portland area.

The target rule was established using a specific set of assumptions made at that time. Any assessment as to how well the region is performing toward the target is allowed to incorporate those assumptions, such as fuel costs, per capita income growth, vehicle fleet, and roadway pricing. 

These model inputs are provided by ODOT for use in regional VisionEval modeling in Oregon.

Therefore, while the total GHG reduction and grams per mile of CO2e will be included in any analysis, the emphasis on achieving *the* ‘target rule’ will be centered on VMT per capita reduction. 

The target rule accounts for vehicles owned or hired by the household and the overall ‘lightweight’ vehicles (less than 10,000 lbs.) within Oregon. That includes light-duty vehicle travel by metropolitan area households (and related light-duty commercial service vehicle travel). The light-duty household travel captures the average daily travel and transportation needs, whether physically traveled by the members of the household or deliveries and miscellaneous commercial travel to their home.

Note: Default 2005 Emission Rate is assumed to be 524 CO2e grams per mile. These may vary by metropolitan area. The 2020 Climate Friendly and Equitable Communities (CFEC) DLCD Target Rules (adopted in August 2022) refer only to the “Target” element, which is defined by a reduction in VMT per capita.

## Set Up Scenarios

VisionEval is typically set up to run many scenarios that explore a broad set of alternative policies and investment priorities that may result from possible policy and project actions, or from a range of future conditions. A full application of VisionEval may examine hundreds or even thousands of permutations of inputs representing many possible future outcomes with the purpose of comparing changes in VMT and GHG outputs relative to the targets set by OAR 660-044. The outputs allow planners and decision-makers to explore the outcomes of each scenario compared to the others, so they can understand and weigh the relative impact and cross-influences, as well as the unintended consequences, of factors represented across the scenarios.

### Scenario Modeling Process and Assumptions:

1.  ***Future Baseline Reference Scenario:***

    -   Financially constrained adopted local plans[²](#_bookmark1) with

    -   “Plans &Trends” scenario levels for state actions (AP)

2.  ***Target Rule Scenario***

    -   MPO Reference scenario with

        -   “STS-Vision” level of allowed State-led Actions (STSRec)

        -   Special “TR” inputs to better match assumptions when the Target Rule was developed (i.e., income growth, fuel price forecast, fuel carbon intensity)

3.  ***Sensitivity Testing Scenarios:***

    -   Changes to MPO Reference Scenario reflecting more/less ambitious policies and actions.

4.  ***Key Paths and Preferred Scenario:***

    -   Combined State and Local actions that meet local goals and that the region supports.

    -   Does not need to be financially constrained and can include “STS-Vision” level of any state-led actions supported by the region.

### Future Baseline Reference Scenario

As noted in Section 2.3, the future baseline or reference scenario reflects the adopted plans and current trends assuming no new or unplanned transportation and land use changes. All other scenario results can be stated as changes above or below this baseline. The baseline scenario is typically in the same “existing year” as the regional transportation plan.

The baseline scenario will be backcast to the year 2005, as the Oregon GHG reduction targets are set as a percent reduction from year 2005 emissions. The 2005 inputs can draw from those in the statewide VisionEval model.

The 2005 values in VMT per capita and GHG per capita for the households in the target area are used to set the reference values by which the Targets in Table 13 are applied to.

For example, if the 2005 VMT per capita were 16.5 then the Target in year 2045 (using a 25% reduction) is 12.4.

### Target Rule Scenario

The Target Rule Scenario, also often referred to as the Preferred Scenario, represents the policy and investment strategies to implement that will get a metropolitan area to its GHG reduction target from 2005 levels (see Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 660, Division 44 Metropolitan Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets). The scenario must be measured and calibrated to meet or exceed the target. This could be the preferred scenario from previous planning processes. In tracking progress to the OAR’s GHG target, this scenario is allowed to assume state-led actions in the STS, such as vehicle-fuel regulations and pricing policies, along with model assumptions at the time the target was set (I.e. fuel price, income growth). These scenario changes have the effect of isolating the progress that is within local agency authority. As such, progress to the target is often characterized as household VMT/capita metric, rather than GHG. See Section 5 for more detail about the VisionEval assumptions when tracking progress to the OAR GHG target rule.

### Alternative Scenarios 

Example conditions to explore in scenarios include strong or weak economic growth, demographic shifts, or deployment of new technologies like app-based ridesharing (e.g., ride-hailing like Uber & Lyft). Model scenarios are defined in terms of combinations of individual model input parameters and policy choices. Combining all input values will result in 10,368 total scenarios, which would take days to run. A user usually does not need all the possible combinations of scenarios.

As noted, running all combinations of the modeling levers would result in thousands of alternative scenarios. However, a clear framework or set of priorities can help identify the scenarios that will reflect trends and investment choices that are of top interest to jurisdictions and stakeholders. Scenarios may also be used to reflect specific strategies to forecast the effectiveness of certain types of actions. The scenarios can be used to test “what if” trends and the effects on existing or planned changes.
